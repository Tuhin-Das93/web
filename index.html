                    <h3>India's Civil Aviation Sector: Exploring Recent Performance Trends</h3>
                    <p>
                        The study reveals that the aviation sector in India has recovered largely from the adverse impact of the pandemic in 2022. 
                        It has more or less reached the level of pre-pandemic passenger traffic volumes both in terms of domestic as well as international passengers.
                        Indigo is the most dominant player in the market with a share of more than 50% of the domestic passenger traffic. 
                        Vistara, Go Air, Air India and Spice Jet are significantly behind Indigo with a share close to 9% for each of them.

                    <p>
                        This paper shows the disparate development in Uttar Pradesh in terms of economic activities and, as a consequence, a skewed household income distribution.
                        A large proportion of car sales is concentrated in a few districts, suggesting lesser affordability towards purchasing high-valued assets for most districts.
