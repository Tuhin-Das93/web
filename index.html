                    <h3>India's Civil Aviation Sector: Exploring Recent Performance Trends</h3>
                    <p>The study reveals that the aviation sector in India has recovered largely from the adverse impact of the pandemic in 2022. 
                        It has more or less reached the level of pre-pandemic passenger traffic volumes both in terms of domestic as well as international passengers.
                        Indigo is the most dominant player in the market with a share of more than 50% of the domestic passenger traffic. Vistara, Go Air, Air India and Spice Jet are significantly behind Indigo with a share close to 9% for each of them. 
                        The number of players has also declined over time in the Indian aviation market. International experience suggests that the aviation sector goes hand in hand with economic recovery. 
                        India, with a relatively stable GDP growth, shows better performance compared to most countries in developed as well as developing economies. 
                        With a positive outlook regarding economic growth in India, the aviation sector is poised to grow faster in the coming years.

                    <h3>Skewed Passenger Car Market in Uttar Pradesh: An Exploration</h3>
                    <p>This paper shows the disparate development in Uttar Pradesh in terms of economic activities and, as a consequence, a skewed household income distribution.
                    A large proportion of car sales is concentrated in a few districts, suggesting lesser affordability towards purchasing high-valued assets for most districts.</p>
