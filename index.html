                    <p>The study reveals that the aviation sector in India has recovered largely from the adverse impact of thepandemic in 2022. 
                        It is more at less reached the level of pre-pandemic period passenger traffic volumeboth in terms of domestic as well as international passengers.
                        Indigo is the most dominant player inthe market with a share of more than 50% of the domestic passenger traffic. Vistara, Go Air, Air Indiaand Spice Jet are significantly behind Indigo with a share close to 9% for each of them. 
                        The numberof players have also declined over time in the Indian aviation market. International experiencesuggests that the aviation sector goes hand in hand with the economic recovery. 
                        India with a relativelystable GDP growth shows better performance compared to most of the countries in developed as wellas developing economies.
